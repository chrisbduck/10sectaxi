	<h1><u>Ten-Second Taxi</u></h1>
	<p>You are the taxi driver in a town full of incredibly impatient people.  Everyone wants to get to their destination
	in under ten seconds, and will jump out of your taxi if you take too long!</p>
	<p>Controls should be self-explanatory - just drive.</p>
	<p>I ran out of time to do auto-reverse, power-ups, opposition or traffic cars, more commentary, cash rewards for
	faster driving (it's currently just based on distance), nitro, handbrake turn, a menu system, a decent intro web
	page, etc.  Next time, maybe! :)</p>
	<p>I also did this with very little Internet access - only mobile phone browsing  That was a challenge.</p>
	<p>Cheers to the makers of Autotracker and SFXR in particular.  I also used GIMP, Emscripten, QtCreator, C++,
	Python, etc.</p>
